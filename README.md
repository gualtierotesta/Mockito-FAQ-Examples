MOCKITO FAQ EXAMPLES
====================

This project is the companion of the Mockito FAQ page available on [https://gualtierotesta.wordpress.com/mockito-faq/](https://gualtierotesta.wordpress.com/mockito-faq/ "Mockito FAQ")

Please refer to that page and to the README files included in this project for the explanations.

The project has a Maven multi-module structure with Java 1.7 source level and UTF-8 encoding.

Modules:

1. **module-jar** is a plain Java JAR module. No dependencies except Mockito and jUnit.


If you find errors or you would like to see more example, just create a new issue on the [project jira](https://github.com/gualtierotesta/Mockito-FAQ-Examples/issues).

**IMPORTANT**: This project is a *work-in-progress* and it will be continuously extended to cover all Mockito use cases.
